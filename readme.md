## 1. Introduction  - Oscar (3-5 questions)
> Our topic of research is ‘is there a correlation between obesity rates per state and total fast food restaurants per state in the U.S.’ Per the UN, roughly two out of three U.S. adults are overweight or obese (69 percent). We plan to further expand this research into seeing if graduation rates and income rates are correlated down the line. From personal experience, as I saw my older siblings become more educated through college, they began to research what they ate and what they have been eating. This motivated them to eat healthier organic and vegan based products, foregoing meat nearly entirely from their diets. In university you learn to do a lot of research to acquire knowledge, you learn how to find answers that satiate your curiosity, but for those that choose not obtain a post-secondary education, do they learn how to research the best products to consume? Or do they consume the food nearest or easiest to acquire simply out of convenience without researching whats inside the food? Do states with higher concentrations of fast food restaurants tend to have higher obesity rates? Do states with high incomes have higher or lower obesity rates, and what inferences can be made about the results? These are the questions I will be asking throughout this project.

> Our topic is 'is there a correlation between obesity rates per state and total fast food restaurants per state in the US.' We found three different data sets. The first dataset contains data on food nutrition for fast food restaurants such as Pizza Hut, McDonald’s, Starbucks, etc. It provides information on the fat percentages of each food item on the menu as well as the nutrition facts such as the number of carbohydrates and sugar in a food item. Another data set contained the percentage of adults with obesity in the United States in the year of 2021. This data study was conducted to determine the percentage of adults who self-reported that they are obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of 30.0 or higher. This dataset has information from all 50 states except for Florida.  And we found our last data set on the number of fast food restaurants across the United States. This dataset provides us information on how many fast food restaurants there are in total in every single state. With these data sets, we plan on comparing how the number of fast food restaurants per state is impacting the percentage rate of obesity in adults in that state.

* Who collected the data?
> In order, CDC, Rakkesh Aravind G and Datafiniti
* How was the data collected or generated?
> In order, Survey (CDC), BeautifulSoup, Requests, JSON, PDF-to-CSV (Rakkesh Aravind G) and unknown (Khushi Shahh).
* Why was the data collected?
> To find percentage of adults who self-reported they are obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of 30.0 or higher (CDC). Motive unknown (Rakkesh Aravind G). Rank cities with the most and least fast-food restaurants across the U.S.(Khushi SHahh)
* How many observations (rows) are in your data?
> In order, 50 (CDC), unknown (Rakkesh Aravind G), 10000 (Khushi Shahh). 
* How many features (columns) are in the data?
> In order, 50 (CDC), 14 (Rakkesh Aravind G), 11 (Khushi Shaah).
* What, if any, ethical questions or questions of power do you need to consider when working with this data? 
> None, these groups of people are simply gathering data on how many restaurants there are per state, the nutrition facts of menu items at fast food restaurants and declaring people obese based on their own deductions.
* What are possible limitations or problems with this data? (at least 200 words)
> Some possible implications that could come with these datasets are when the data was collected. Outdated data could provide an inaccurate image of how things are in the present, while most of this data is fairly recent, new data is always being collected about obesity rates, about how many restaurants exist, if there are plans to build new restaurants in new areas and if companies are beginning to switch over to healthier products to fight the obesity epidemic. These happenings could skew our data projects by providing inaccurate projections. A limitation of the fast food restaurant data set is that it doesn't provide a holistic view of how many total restaurants there are in the US, it caps at 10,000 restaurants.

## 4. Implications - Elisha
> While many people understand that obesity is a widespread health issue due to its prevalence in the world today, this surface-leveled understanding is often it. We hope to dive into the why through our datasets by taking in a broad range of locations, considering various factors such as the presence of nutritious versus processed foods in low and high obesity states, and comparing the patterns within them, so that we can then aggregate important data on obesity and allow others to learn from our findings, too. Our goal with this project is to educate people on the common links towards obesity so that they become aware of the health precautions they need to take, along with grabbing the attention of nutritionists, food companies, and food scientists to encourage conscious food design. Acknowledging the rapid growth of obesity and ensuring people are educated about it is imperative; only after understanding the problem and its causes can we create effective solutions to counter it.
