## 1. Introduction  - Oscar (3-5 questions)
> Our topic of research is ‘is there a correlation between obesity rates per state and total fast food restaurants per state in the US’. I plan to further expand this research into seeing if graduation rates and income rates are correlated down the line. From personal experience, as I saw my older siblings become more educated through college, they began to research what they ate and what they have been eating. This motivated them to eat healthier organic and vegan based products, foregoing meat nearly entirely from their diets. In university you learn to do a lot of research to acquire knowledge, you learn how to find answers that satiate your curiosity, but for those that don't go, do they learn how to research the best ways to take care of themselves? Or do they only consume the food nearest or easiest to acquire simply out of convenience without a second thought as to whats inside the food? Do states with high amounts of fast food restaurants tend to have higher obesity rates? Do states with high incomes have higher or lower obesity rates, and what inferences can be made about the results?

> Our topic is how does the total number of all fast food restaurants in a state affect the obesity rates per state in America. We found three different data sets. The first dataset contains data on food nutrition for fast food restaurants such as Pizza Hut, McDonald’s, Starbucks, etc. It provides information on the fat percentages of each food item on the menu as well as the nutrition facts such as the number of carbohydrates and sugar in a food item. Another data set contained the percentage of adults with obesity in the United States in the year of 2021. This data study was conducted to determine the percentage of adults who self-reported that they are obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of 30.0 or higher. This dataset has information from all 50 states except for Florida.  And we found our last data set on the number of fast food restaurants across the United States. This dataset provides us information on how many fast food restaurants there are in total in every single state. With these data sets, we plan on comparing how the number of fast food restaurants per state is impacting the percentage rate of obesity in adults in that state.

## 4. Implications - Elisha
> While many people understand that obesity is a widespread health issue due to its prevalence in the world today, this surface-leveled understanding is often it. We hope to dive into the why through our datasets by taking in a broad range of locations, considering various factors such as the presence of nutritious versus processed foods in low and high obesity states, and comparing the patterns within them, so that we can then aggregate important data on obesity and allow others to learn from our findings, too. Our goal with this project is to educate people on the common links towards obesity so that they become aware of the health precautions they need to take, along with grabbing the attention of nutritionists, food companies, and food scientists to encourage conscious food design. Acknowledging the rapid growth of obesity and ensuring people are educated about it is imperative; only after understanding the problem and its causes can we create effective solutions to counter it.
