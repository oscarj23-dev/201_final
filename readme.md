While many people understand that obesity is a widespread health issue due to its prevalence in the world today, this surface-leveled understanding is often it. We hope to dive into the why through our datasets by taking in a broad range of locations, considering various factors such as the presence of nutritious versus processed foods in low and high obesity states, and comparing the patterns within them, so that we can then aggregate important data on obesity and allow others to learn from our findings, too. Our goal with this project is to educate people on the common links towards obesity so that they become aware of the health precautions they need to take, along with grabbing the attention of nutritionists, food companies, and food scientists to encourage conscious food design. Acknowledging the rapid growth of obesity and ensuring people are educated about it is imperative; only after understanding the problem and its causes can we create effective solutions to counter it.
